## Style Guidelines:

- Background Color: A very dark, desaturated blue-grey (#21252C). This deep shade sets a professional, calm, and modern dark-mode aesthetic, appropriate for a safety and utility application, providing excellent contrast for brighter elements.
- Primary Color: A bright and versatile blue (#4A90E2). This color is strategically used for interactive components like primary buttons, selected states, progress indicators, and crucial information highlights. It signifies trustworthiness and provides a clear visual anchor on the dark background.
- Accent Color: A vibrant cyan (#00BCD4). This analogous color provides a striking contrast, ideal for drawing attention to alerts, critical actions, and key user feedback, ensuring high visibility without overwhelming the dark theme.
- Headline and Body Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif). Chosen for its clarity, readability across various screen sizes, and modern, objective aesthetic that aligns with the functional and utility-focused nature of a Google-style application.
- Adopt a clean and concise set of Material Design-inspired icons. These will offer immediate visual recognition for functions like location services, calling, search, and informational access, maintaining a cohesive and intuitive user experience.
- Employ a mobile-first, highly responsive design featuring a card-based structure. This approach organizes content logically with clear hierarchy, ensuring easy navigation and information accessibility, even in high-stress situations. Layouts will be optimized for single-hand use.
- Utilize subtle and functional micro-animations for state changes, navigation transitions, and interactive feedback. These animations will enhance user experience by providing smooth visual cues without adding unnecessary cognitive load or delays during critical use.
